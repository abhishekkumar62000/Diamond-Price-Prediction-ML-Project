# Diamond Price Prediction ML Project 💎📈

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! In this repository, I developed a machine learning model that predicts diamond prices using Python. This project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning techniques. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

Today, I built a robust project to forecast diamond prices, leveraging data science methodologies. Here are the key components of the project:

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Analyzed diamond dataset to uncover insights and patterns. 
  - Visualized data distribution and relationships among features.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates.
  - Standardized data formats for consistency.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features to improve model performance.
  - Conducted feature selection to identify the most impactful variables.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented various algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
  - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assessed models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
  - Visualized predictions vs. actual prices for better understanding.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation 🥞
  - NumPy for numerical operations ➕
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization 📊
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning 🤖


### 📖 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekkumar62000/Diamond-Price-Prediction-ML-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd diamond-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.  

### 📅 Future Work

- Improve model accuracy by exploring advanced algorithms.
